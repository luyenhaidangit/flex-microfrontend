# AGENTS Instructions

This repository contains the Angular frontend for the Flex platform.
The backend services and API contracts are maintained in a separate
repository:

https://github.com/luyenhaidangit/flex-microservice

Whenever implementing features here, read the code and documentation in
that backend repository to understand available endpoints, request
payloads and response structures. Keep the frontend models and services
in sync with the backend.
